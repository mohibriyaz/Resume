    "bio": "I am a master's student in computer science at Politecnico di Milano, pursuing my passion for web development and software engineering. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from Amity University, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I have also acquired multiple certifications in digital marketing, career edge, and MERN stack from Google, Tata Consultancy Services, and Udemy, respectively, to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field. I have recently completed a four-month internship at LeLafe IT Solutions, where I contributed to the quality assurance of the project 'Educian', which is an online learning platform, using automation tools and techniques in Visual Studio. I am motivated by the opportunity to use my skills and expertise to create positive social impact and support the mission and vision of the organization. I believe I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I have lived and studied in different countries and cultures, and speak three languages: English, Hindi, and Urdu.",
